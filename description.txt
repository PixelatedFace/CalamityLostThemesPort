Ported to 1.4.4 by pixelated_face (more of a rewrite)

Originaly made by Emissary Of Infinity (I can take this down if you're already working on a port)
Music by DM DOKURO
Textures taken from the original mod

Currently adds: 

The Planetoids theme back (Blessing of the Moon)
(It will override the Arsenal Lab theme if you dont want that you can change the priority in the mod config)

Rest of the music can be found in the Calamity Extra Music Mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835214226)
(This Mod adds some of the missing music boxes from Calamity Extra Music)
