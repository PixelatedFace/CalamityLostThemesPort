original description :

# Calamity: The Lost Themes
Adds the five "lost" themes of the Calamity soundtrack, produced by DM Dokuro and Turquoise.
For further details regarding implementation and permissions, please visit the home page at https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/calamity-the-lost-themes.93089/
Does not actually require the Calamity mod to work, but it's a much better experience that way.

Playlist:
